      <h1>About the Author</h1>
      
    <p>John Blanchard Jefferson combines a lifetime of extraordinary experiences into his novels. He was a Marine F-8E fighter pilot who flew 150 missions during the Vietnam War where he was awarded The Distinguished Flying Cross and seven Air Medals, following that he had a tour on the ground with 3rd Battalion 9th Marines as a forward air controller where he was awarded the Bronze Star with combat V and the Purple Heart. Jefferson also piloted F-102 and F-4 aircraft for the California Air National Guard, serving a total of 24 years and retiring with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

    <p>While continuing his military service, Jefferson also transitioned to commercial aviation, spending 34 and a half years flying internationally for TWA and American Airlines.</p>

    <p>Never content with a single career, Jefferson also worked as a private investigator for 12 years, bringing a keen investigative perspective to his storytelling.

His love for adventure continues with scuba diving and piloting an airplane he personally built - a testament to his technical skill and adventurous spirit.</p>
