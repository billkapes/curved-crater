          Timid Revenge is a gripping tale of long-simmering vengeance and small-town corruption set in the fictional town of Riverdale, Missouri. This suspenseful thriller follows Oscar Martin, a mild-mannered shopkeeper who has spent decades being overlooked, underestimated, and bullied by the town's powerful elite. 

          Oscar runs Martin's General Store, a fixture on Main Street for nearly forty years. Behind his meek exterior lies a keen observer who has documented the corruption of Riverdale's triumvirate of power: Mayor Frank Wellman, Police Chief Ray Donovan, and banker Howard Kline. These three men have controlled the town since high school, where they first tormented Oscar and established their dominance. 

          When Oscar discovers that Southern Missouri Bank is being used to launder drug money, and that the town's leadership is directly involved with a Mexican cartel, he formulates an audacious plan. With the help of high school English teacher Abigale Conner—another outsider who's faced the town's cruelty—Oscar plots to steal millions in cartel cash and bring down the corrupt power structure that has oppressed Riverdale for generations. 

          What follows is a masterful game of cat and mouse, as the unassuming shopkeeper executes an elaborate scheme involving hidden tunnels, faked deaths, and strategic misdirection. The novel explores themes of justice, power, visibility, and redemption, while asking provocative questions about morality and vengeance. 

          Jefferson crafts a riveting narrative where the overlooked protagonist turns his perceived weaknesses into strengths, proving that patience and attention to detail can overcome brute force and arrogance. With rich character development and unexpected twists, Timid Revenge delivers a satisfying story of a man who finally refuses to accept his assigned place in a rigged social hierarchy. 

          A fascinating exploration of small-town dynamics and the hidden strength of those society deems insignificant, this novel reminds us that the quiet ones often observe the most—and sometimes, they're taking notes.

          In the quiet town where everyone knows everyone's business, private investigator Dave Harper never expected to be pulled into a life-altering conspiracy. But when his niece Emily dies from what officials call "just another fentanyl overdose," Dave's instincts tell him something doesn't add up. 

          As a former sheriff's deputy with a keen eye for detail, Dave notices discrepancies in Emily's toxicology report that others have overlooked. His investigation leads him to a disturbing discovery: Emily wasn't just another victim of America's opioid crisis—she was an unwitting test subject in a dangerous pharmaceutical experiment code-named "Project Clarity." 

          Following the trail of evidence, Dave uncovers a conspiracy reaching from local healthcare providers to powerful pharmaceutical executives, corrupt government officials, and law enforcement—including his former colleague, Sheriff Tom Burke. At the center of it all stands the brilliant but ruthless Dr. Lauren Chambers, whose ambition to create a revolutionary pain medication led her to cross unthinkable ethical boundaries. 

          As bodies pile up and attempts are made on Dave's life, he forms an unlikely alliance with Katherine Abbott, a rogue FDA investigator fighting her own battles against a system designed to protect profits over people. Together, they race to expose the truth before Chambers' deadly drug reaches the market and claims thousands more lives. 

          But when Chambers escapes custody and flees the country, Dave must decide how far he's willing to go for justice. His pursuit leads him into moral gray areas he never thought he'd enter, forcing him to work with Raymond Vance—a mysterious "problem solver" whose methods are as effective as they are questionable. 

          From small-town America to the shadowy corners of Southeast Asia, "Drug Payback" is a heart-pounding thriller about one man's relentless quest for justice in a world where pharmaceutical greed, corruption, and indifference to human suffering have become the prescription of choice. It's a story that asks: When the system fails, what price are you willing to pay for justice?

          When retired Navy SEAL Jack Reeves discovers Linda Washington washed ashore on his private island—the sole escapee from a human trafficking operation—he has no idea their paths crossing will ignite a dangerous quest for justice. Together with Jack's cousin Marcus, a skilled con artist with a moral compass, they uncover a shocking truth: a beloved television personality, Vanessa Moore, and influential Senator William Preston are secretly running one of the largest human trafficking networks in North America. 

          As Jack, Marcus, and Linda orchestrate an elaborate scheme to bring down these powerful criminals, they find themselves aided by a mysterious operative whose identity remains hidden even from them. Their plan: create an elaborate financial trap, drain the traffickers' offshore accounts, and expose their crimes to the world. 

          But in a world where wealth buys protection and influence secures immunity, conventional justice isn't enough.
